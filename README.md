	Description
</h2>

The aim of this project is to explore ray-casting with the goal to make a dynamic view inside a maze.

It is the second design project in the 42Cursus and the students are able to learn about graphics, events and masks, colors, fill shapes, windows, etc.

To be able to do this 3D Game is necessary to "explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

The project must be done using the Ray-Casting principles and it should be a 3D graphical representation from inside of a maze from a first-person perpective.
